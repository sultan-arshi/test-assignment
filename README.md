## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install

2. Start the Application

Start the app using Expo:

npx expo start

Options to Open the App:

	•	Development Build: Use for full-featured app development.
	•	Android Emulator: Test the app on an Android emulator.
	•	iOS Simulator: Test the app on an iOS simulator.
	•	Expo Go: A sandbox environment for previewing app development.

🌐 API Details

The app fetches user data from the JSONPlaceholder API. This provides mock data for development and testing.

🏗 Application Architecture

The project follows an Atomic Design Structure, organized into:
	•	Atoms: Basic UI components (e.g., buttons, checkboxes).
	•	Molecules: Combinations of atoms (e.g., input fields with labels).
	•	Organisms: Complex components composed of atoms and molecules (e.g., data table).

You can find all the components in the components/atoms, components/molecules, and components/organisms directories.

✨ Features

	1.	Data Table:
	•	Displays user data including name, age, date of birth, and a checkbox.
	•	Provides search functionality to filter rows.
	•	Allows sorting for each column in ascending or descending order.
	2.	Reusable Components:
	•	Built with modular and reusable components for scalability.
	3.	API Integration:
	•	Fetches user data dynamically using a custom hook.

Start exploring the code and customize the application as needed! Happy coding! 😊
